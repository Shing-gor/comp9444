# Project Title: Sentiment Analysis of Facial Expressions, ID: 071

### Area of Research: Computer Vision (COMP9444)

### Problem Statement
This project aims to classify different images of faces into a probability distribution of different categories of emotions. Being able to identify a person’s emotional state based on their facial expression is essential to medical and law enforcement industries. For example, in psychotherapy, using deep learning sentiment analysis of a patient’s facial expression to determine their likely emotional state would assist a psychotherapist in catering their treatment to their patient’s current disposition.

### Dataset
- **Dataset URL**: [FER Dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/fer)

### Task
Students will perform deep learning research on the FER+ dataset that builds upon the widely used FER dataset by allowing a neural network to learn a probability distribution for each of the FER dataset’s images. For example, the target distribution for an image may be 40% angry, 20% disgust, and 40% sadness. Students should experiment with simple customised convolutional neural networks, such as 9 or 12 layer networks, before considering residual networks such as a Resnet.
